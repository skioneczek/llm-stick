# Risk Register

- **Air-gap bypass via misconfigured adapters**
  - Severity: High
  - Owner: Security Lead
  - Mitigation: Enforce adapter check in Paranoid; run self-check after slider changes.
  - Status: Open
- **Voice Mode autostart regression**
  - Severity: Medium
  - Owner: Accessibility Lead
  - Mitigation: Default Voice Mode OFF; require manual toggle with audit log.
  - Status: Monitoring
- **Host write permissions leaking**
  - Severity: Medium
  - Owner: Systems Lead
  - Mitigation: Restrict host access via `bind_host_path()` read-only alias; audit on enforcement.
  - Status: Open
- **R-001 Network guard false-positive on some OS builds**
  - Severity: Medium
  - Owner: Security Lead
  - Mitigation: internal guard fallback + revert on failure
  - Status: Open (Day 1 note: Standard/Hardened probes recorded in `tests/e2e/smoke.md` to monitor guard accuracy.)
- **R-002 Dynamic source selection leaks or slows indexing**
  - Severity: Medium
  - Owner: Security Lead
  - Mitigation: Constrain `Set Source` to approved read-only roots, require explicit user confirmation, warn if folder exceeds thresholds (e.g., >1,000 files or >2 GB), allow cancel, validate via `services/security/source_guard.validate_source()` audit, and instruct Data to rebuild indexes only after a successful audit while retaining prior index on failure.
  - Status: Open
- **R-003 OCR / crypto provider unavailable at ingest time**
  - Severity: Medium
  - Owner: Platform Lead
  - Mitigation: Detect missing OCR/crypto binaries up front, log via audit surface, fall back to signed stubs, and keep ingest pipeline pluggable so providers can be hot-swapped without blocking HOST_LOCAL ingest.
  - Status: Open
- **R-004 Ingestion bleed mixes client corpora**
  - Severity: High
  - Owner: Data Lead
  - Mitigation: Require per-client registry with unique source slug, only allow ingest from registered sources, enforce ledger/index tagging, and abort if paths fall outside the active client scope.
  - Status: Open
- **R-005 Web UI loopback allowance expands socket surface**
  - Severity: Medium
  - Owner: Security Lead
  - Mitigation: Allowlist 127.0.0.1 only, ship strict CSP with bundled assets, deny external fonts/CDNs, and disable the UI server entirely in Paranoid mode with fallback UI.
  - Status: Open
- **R-006 PDF engine unavailable offline**
  - Severity: Medium
  - Owner: Designer
  - Mitigation: Treat wkhtmltopdf/WeasyPrint as optional modules, keep browser Print-to-PDF fallback acceptable for Day-2 acceptance, and vendor/sign offline engine on Day-3 with SHA capture before enabling default PDF export.
  - Status: Open
- **R-008 Export fallback coverage gaps**
  - Severity: Medium
  - Owner: Platform Lead
  - Mitigation: Document fallback limitations (no embedded assets), add regression checks to ensure large-print styling persists, and upgrade to bundled engine once Day-3 packaging completes.
  - Status: Open
- **R-007 Thread store growth exceeds device limits**
  - Severity: Medium
  - Owner: Platform Lead
  - Mitigation: Archive or rotate threads beyond threshold, run periodic compaction job, and surface storage alerts in audit log.
  - Status: Open
