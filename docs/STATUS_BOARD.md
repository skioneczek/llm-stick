# STATUS BOARD — LLM Stick
_As of 2025-10-09 (ET). This file is authoritative. Each role must read this first._

## Completed (Day 1)
- Planner: Decisions logged in [docs/Decision_Log.md](docs/Decision_Log.md); R-001 tracked in [docs/Risk_Register.md](docs/Risk_Register.md) with probe evidence note. (Commit links pending initial git history.)
- Designer: Large-text quick start + voice/UI specs published in [docs/QuickStart_card.md](docs/QuickStart_card.md) and [apps/ui/voice_script.md](../apps/ui/voice_script.md), [apps/ui/states.md](../apps/ui/states.md); Voice Mode confirmations captured.
- Security: Preflight checklist and audit strings documented in [docs/Security_Checklist.md](docs/Security_Checklist.md); live interfaces enumerated in [services/preflight/README.md](../services/preflight/README.md).
- Data: Prompt templates with plan → answer → sources flow documented in [docs/prompt_templates.md](docs/prompt_templates.md); retriever confirmed offline-only on Samples corpus.
- Integrator: Standard/Hardened `--probe`/`--ask` outputs recorded with commands and environment info in [tests/e2e/smoke.md](../tests/e2e/smoke.md).
- Platform: Repo skeleton, Samples corpus, indexer/retriever pipeline, host alias audit, memory ledger stub all landed; launcher wired to local index.

## Acceptance (Day 1)
- Standard & Hardened: audits print; inline probe says `DNS: BLOCKED (ok)` / `SOCKET: BLOCKED (ok)`; `--ask` works on Samples with sources.
- Paranoid: fails with adapters on; passes with adapters off.

## Links / Files to read first
- `docs/Decision_Log.md`, `docs/Risk_Register.md`, `docs/Security_Checklist.md`, `docs/QuickStart_card.md`, `docs/prompt_templates.md`, `tests/e2e/smoke.md`

## Day 2 Plan (In Progress — 2025-10-09)
- **Security Lead (13:30 ET deliverable):** Ship encrypted PIN vault swap (`services/security/pin_gate.py`, `services/security/keystore.py`) with updated audits and lockout logging.
- **Designer & Accessibility Lead (17:00 ET deliverable):** Finalize Voice Mode enable/disable confirmations and large-text mock updates in `apps/ui/voice_script.md` and `apps/ui/states.md`.
- **Data Lead (18:30 ET deliverable):** Rebuild Samples index via `services/indexer/build_index.py`; attach provenance note inside `Data/index.json`.
- **Integrator Lead (20:00 ET deliverable):** Execute `tests/e2e/day2.md` flows; archive launcher + guard logs under `tests/e2e/artifacts/`.
- **Program Manager (21:00 ET deliverable):** Close acceptance run per `docs/Acceptance_Script.md`; confirm risk review for R-001 with new probes.

## Micro Update — 2025-10-09 (12:58 ET)
Done: Published Day 2 acceptance slice (`docs/Acceptance_Script.md`) and mirrored checklist (`tests/e2e/day2.md`); logged UTC decisions.
Next: Wait on Security vault handoff and Data index rebuild to execute acceptance.
Blockers: None; monitor R-001 during guard probes tonight.
