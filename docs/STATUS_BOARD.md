# STATUS BOARD — LLM Stick
_As of 2025-10-09 (ET). This file is authoritative. Each role must read this first._

## Completed (Day 1)
- Planner: Decisions logged in [docs/Decision_Log.md](docs/Decision_Log.md); R-001 tracked in [docs/Risk_Register.md](docs/Risk_Register.md) with probe evidence note. (Commit links pending initial git history.)
- Designer: Large-text quick start + voice/UI specs published in [docs/QuickStart_card.md](docs/QuickStart_card.md) and [apps/ui/voice_script.md](../apps/ui/voice_script.md), [apps/ui/states.md](../apps/ui/states.md); Voice Mode confirmations captured.
- Security: Preflight checklist and audit strings documented in [docs/Security_Checklist.md](docs/Security_Checklist.md); live interfaces enumerated in [services/preflight/README.md](../services/preflight/README.md).
- Data: Prompt templates with plan → answer → sources flow documented in [docs/prompt_templates.md](docs/prompt_templates.md); retriever confirmed offline-only on Samples corpus.
- Integrator: Standard/Hardened `--probe`/`--ask` outputs recorded with commands and environment info in [tests/e2e/smoke.md](../tests/e2e/smoke.md).
- Platform: Repo skeleton, Samples corpus, indexer/retriever pipeline, host alias audit, memory ledger stub all landed; launcher wired to local index.

## Acceptance (Day 1)
- Standard & Hardened: audits print; inline probe says `DNS: BLOCKED (ok)` / `SOCKET: BLOCKED (ok)`; `--ask` works on Samples with sources.
- Paranoid: fails with adapters on; passes with adapters off.
