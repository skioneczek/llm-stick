# LLM Stick — Quick Start (Large Text)

1) Open the Start app and enter your 6-digit PIN.  
2) Select your read-only folder (e.g., C:\OCRC_READONLY).  
3) Ask a question in the text box. (Voice Mode is optional — turn it on when you want to speak.)

Tips:
- Security slider: Standard (default) → Hardened → Paranoid.  
- Say/Click “Sources” to hear file names and dates.  
- “Panic” clears temporary data and closes the app.
