# LLM Stick — Quick Start (Large Text)

1) Open the Start app and enter your 6-digit PIN.  
2) Select your read-only folder (e.g., C:\OCRC_READONLY).  
3) Ask a question in the text box. Voice Mode stays OFF until you turn it on.  
4) (Optional) Change or reset your PIN from Settings → Security when you’re signed in.  
5) (Optional) Use "Set Data Folder" to point the stick at a client folder before asking questions.

Tips:
- Security slider: Standard (default) → Hardened → Paranoid.  
- Say/Click “Sources” to hear file names and dates.  
- “Set Data Folder” shows your chosen path and scans locally (may take time).  
- “Ingest” pulls in new files offline; choose Computer or USB storage.  
- “Hotswap” quickly switches between client folders (shows last indexed date).  
- “Panic” clears temporary data and closes the app.
