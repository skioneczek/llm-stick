# Decision Log

- **2025-10-08** PIN pad gates all launch surfaces. Owner: Security Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-09 ET. Rationale: Keep PIN mandatory before any UI renders.
- **2025-10-08** Security slider defaults to Standard, enforces Hardened parity, requires adapter-off check in Paranoid. Owner: Platform Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-10 ET. Rationale: Align air-gap behavior with policy tiers.
- **2025-10-08** Voice Mode ships as manual toggle with audit trail; default OFF. Owner: Accessibility Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-11 ET. Rationale: Respect large-text-first workflow and avoid auto-speech.
- **2025-10-08** Host data exposed via `bind_host_path()` read-only alias only. Owner: Systems Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-09 ET. Rationale: Prevent accidental host writes while enabling offline access.
- **2025-10-08** Adopt shared audit surface (`services/preflight/audit.py`). Owners: Security (PIN/mode), Integrator (host alias), Designer (voice). Due EOD.
- **2025-10-08** Capture Standard/Hardened `--probe`+`--ask` transcripts in `tests/e2e/smoke.md` as acceptance evidence. Owner: Integrator Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-08 ET. Rationale: Prove offline enforcement and citation flow on Samples corpus.
- **2025-10-09** PIN lifecycle files staged under `Data/security/` with lockout counters and recovery rotation workflow. Owner: Security Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-09 ET. Rationale: Support PIN change/reset policy before crypto integration.
- **2025-10-09T16:55Z** Day 2 acceptance slice locked (PIN lifecycle, guard probes, sandbox, voice stub). Owner: Program Manager. Deadline: 2025-10-09T21:00Z. Rationale: Establish verification scope for Day-2 deliverables.
- **2025-10-09T16:55Z** `tests/e2e/day2.md` mirrors `docs/Acceptance_Script.md` step-for-step. Owner: Integrator Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-09T21:00Z. Rationale: Keep automated + manual checks aligned for acceptance.
- **2025-10-09T17:30Z** Add Set Source option to launcher (user selects client folder, still read-only). Owner: Program Manager. Deadline: 2025-10-10T21:00Z. Rationale: Align Q&A context with client-specific corpora while preserving air-gap controls.
- **2025-10-09T18:12Z** Publish UI Reader Presets (48â€“72pt, serif/sans, bold/normal, high-contrast combos) for rapid accessibility switches. Owner: Designer. Deadline: 2025-10-10T17:00Z. Rationale: Ensure low-vision users can toggle compliant layouts without leaving guarded workflow.
- **2025-10-09T19:23Z** Local Web UI binds to 127.0.0.1, bundles offline assets, enforces strict CSP, and forbids external fonts/CDNs. Owner: Platform Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-10T23:00Z. Rationale: Deliver accessible browser surface without opening outbound channels or dependency drift.
- **2025-10-09T18:41Z** Define Ingest Mode defaults: HOST_LOCAL (fast plaintext) vs STICK_ENCRYPTED (requires crypto provider, slower), default HOST_LOCAL with user override. Owner: Platform Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-10T21:00Z. Rationale: Clarify storage options and constraints before ingest E2E, keeping encrypted path opt-in only when hardware is ready.
- **2025-10-09T20:25Z** Print/PDF export scope: Print relies on `@media print` + `window.print()` using large-print preset; PDF export uses local engine (wkhtmltopdf/WeasyPrint) or falls back to "Print to PDF" until offline engine bundled. Owner: Designer. Deadline: 2025-10-11T23:00Z. Rationale: Lock scope for Day-3 visual polish while keeping exports offline-only.
- **2025-10-09T21:15Z** Loopback Web UI server ships with two tracks: (A) Offline-bundled Flask vendor wheel (record SHA256 + version list in packaging notes) and (B) stdlib WSGI fallback without dynamic templates. Owner: Platform Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-10T19:00Z. Rationale: Ensure hardened loopback UI works on devices with/without vendor wheels while preserving auditability.
- **2025-10-09T24:20Z** Export fallback handling: Day-3 task to vendor offline PDF engine (WeasyPrint/wkhtmltopdf) with hash capture; until then, keep browser Print-to-PDF fallback acceptable. Owner: Designer. Deadline: 2025-10-11T23:00Z. Rationale: Maintain acceptance path tonight while scheduling hardened export packaging.

- **2025-10-10T13:10Z** Default LLM profile will lock to `offline-balanced-q4` (llama.cpp 7B, Q4_0) with registry metadata staged in a new `core/llm/profiles.json`. Owner: Platform & LLM Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-10T16:00Z. Rationale: Guarantee predictable Day-3 resource footprint before enabling heavier model swaps.
- **2025-10-10T13:15Z** Checksum policy: All Day-3 model weights, UI bundles, and static assets must ship with SHA256 manifests under a new `packaging/checksums/` directory and verify during launcher warm-up. Owner: Security & Packaging Leads. Deadline: 2025-10-10T17:00Z. Rationale: Preserve offline integrity attestations ahead of streaming rollout.
- **2025-10-10T13:20Z** Streaming Web UI: Standard/Hardened will expose loopback SSE answers; Paranoid keeps the browser disabled while CLI chat remains available. Owner: Web UI Squad. Deadline: 2025-10-10T19:30Z. Rationale: Deliver responsive UX while honouring Paranoid air-gap posture.
