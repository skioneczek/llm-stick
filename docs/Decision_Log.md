# Decision Log

- **2025-10-08** PIN pad gates all launch surfaces. Owner: Security Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-09 ET. Rationale: Keep PIN mandatory before any UI renders.
- **2025-10-08** Security slider defaults to Standard, enforces Hardened parity, requires adapter-off check in Paranoid. Owner: Platform Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-10 ET. Rationale: Align air-gap behavior with policy tiers.
- **2025-10-08** Voice Mode ships as manual toggle with audit trail; default OFF. Owner: Accessibility Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-11 ET. Rationale: Respect large-text-first workflow and avoid auto-speech.
- **2025-10-08** Host data exposed via `bind_host_path()` read-only alias only. Owner: Systems Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-09 ET. Rationale: Prevent accidental host writes while enabling offline access.
- **2025-10-08** Adopt shared audit surface (`services/preflight/audit.py`). Owners: Security (PIN/mode), Integrator (host alias), Designer (voice). Due EOD.
- **2025-10-08** Capture Standard/Hardened `--probe`+`--ask` transcripts in `tests/e2e/smoke.md` as acceptance evidence. Owner: Integrator Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-08 ET. Rationale: Prove offline enforcement and citation flow on Samples corpus.
- **2025-10-09** PIN lifecycle files staged under `Data/security/` with lockout counters and recovery rotation workflow. Owner: Security Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-09 ET. Rationale: Support PIN change/reset policy before crypto integration.
- **2025-10-09T16:55Z** Day 2 acceptance slice locked (PIN lifecycle, guard probes, sandbox, voice stub). Owner: Program Manager. Deadline: 2025-10-09T21:00Z. Rationale: Establish verification scope for Day-2 deliverables.
- **2025-10-09T16:55Z** `tests/e2e/day2.md` mirrors `docs/Acceptance_Script.md` step-for-step. Owner: Integrator Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-09T21:00Z. Rationale: Keep automated + manual checks aligned for acceptance.
- **2025-10-09T17:30Z** Add Set Source option to launcher (user selects client folder, still read-only). Owner: Program Manager. Deadline: 2025-10-10T21:00Z. Rationale: Align Q&A context with client-specific corpora while preserving air-gap controls.
- **2025-10-09T18:12Z** Publish UI Reader Presets (48â€“72pt, serif/sans, bold/normal, high-contrast combos) for rapid accessibility switches. Owner: Designer. Deadline: 2025-10-10T17:00Z. Rationale: Ensure low-vision users can toggle compliant layouts without leaving guarded workflow.
- **2025-10-09T19:23Z** Local Web UI binds to 127.0.0.1, bundles offline assets, enforces strict CSP, and forbids external fonts/CDNs. Owner: Platform Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-10T23:00Z. Rationale: Deliver accessible browser surface without opening outbound channels or dependency drift.
- **2025-10-09T18:41Z** Define Ingest Mode defaults: HOST_LOCAL (fast plaintext) vs STICK_ENCRYPTED (requires crypto provider, slower), default HOST_LOCAL with user override. Owner: Platform Lead. Deadline: 2025-10-10T21:00Z. Rationale: Clarify storage options and constraints before ingest E2E, keeping encrypted path opt-in only when hardware is ready.
